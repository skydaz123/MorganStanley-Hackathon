# morgan-stanley-frontend

### Git Logistics [MUST READ]
- We will use `main` branch to host our production code.
- We will use `dev` branch to host any development code.
- Please do not commit directly to dev. Do the next bullet point instead.
- Please branch out from the `dev` branch into `feature/name-of-what-you-are-working-on`.
- When you are done, please make a pull request from your feature branch to `dev`.
- When we are ready, we will make a pull request from `dev` to `main` to push to production.

### Technologies
- **MUI** for styling, components, and icons
- **Redux Toolkit** for connecting to server and caching responses
- **Redux** for state management
- *More TBA after backend decides on their technologies*

### .env
You will not be able to run the project later down the line without a proper .env file. Please get it from us.
